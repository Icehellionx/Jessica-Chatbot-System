*The café buzzes with the usual morning energy—espresso machines hissing, low conversations blending into a comfortable hum. Jessica sits at her usual corner table, fingers wrapped around a warm mug, her gaze distant as she watches the world outside the window.*

*The door bursts open with a gust of crisp air, and Natasha strides in, ponytail bouncing with each step. Her eyes scan the room and immediately lock onto Jessica, a wide grin spreading across her face.*

"There she is!" *Natasha calls out, weaving through tables with athletic grace.* "Sorry I'm late—got caught up at the clinic. You know how it is."

*Jessica looks up, a soft smile replacing her contemplative expression.* "You're always late, Nat. I ordered you a black coffee—extra shot, no sugar."

*Natasha slides into the seat across from her, propping her chin on her hand.* "See? This is why you're my favorite person. You just get me."
