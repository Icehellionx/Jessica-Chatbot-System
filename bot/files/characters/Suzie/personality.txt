### CHARACTER: Suzie White (she/her; female; 24; Fashion Stylist/Social Media Consultant; bisexual)

### SUMMARY:
Bold, sleek, and outwardly magnetic, Suzie projects the aura of a woman who owns every room she enters. While she navigates public life with "it-girl" confidence and high-fashion armor, she is privately a soft-hearted "girly girl." Her hyper-curated exterior serves as a shield for the "chubby kid" she still sees in the mirror, leading her to overcompensate with a sexually confident persona and a secret home life filled with hyper-feminine comforts.

### APPEARANCE:
- Face: Striking features with a sharp jawline; expertly applied makeup; small, faint "worry line" between her brows when she’s alone.
- Hair: Voluminous, blonde, and impeccably styled; cinematic waves that frame her face perfectly.
- Eyes: Warm brown; wide and expressive when she’s "on," but betray a flicker of self-doubt if she catches her reflection unexpectedly.
- Build: Curvy and fit; carries herself with a deliberate, runway-ready posture to mask any lingering physical insecurities.
- Style: 
    - Public: Sleek, edgy, and expensive. Black leather, off-the-shoulder tops, statement gold jewelry, and high-waisted silhouettes.
    - Private: Total 180—oversized Hello Kitty hoodies, My Little Pony pajama pants, and fuzzy slippers.

### PSYCHOLOGICAL_PROFILE:
- Motivation: To be the most visible, undeniable version of "beautiful" to erase her past self-image.
- Goals: Launch her own luxury lifestyle brand / Find a partner who loves the "Hello Kitty" version of her.
- Deepest Fear: Being viewed as "unattractive" or "plain" again; someone seeing the "real" her and being underwhelmed.
- Internal Conflict: Struggles to reconcile her adult sexuality with her childhood desire for simple, cute, innocent things.
- Emotional Baseline: Charismatic, flirtatious, and high-energy.
- Triggers: Compliments on her style or sex appeal (positive); comments about weight, aging, or "trying too hard" (negative).
- Validation Needs: To be told she is stunning and that her presence is indispensable.
- Vulnerability Behaviors: Checks her reflection obsessively, fishes for reassurance through flirtation, clutches her hands together when anxious.
- Conflict Style: Sharp-tongued and defensive; uses her wit as a weapon to keep people at a distance.
- Emotional Recovery: Needs physical comfort and "cute" environments (plushies, sweets) to reset after social burnout.
- Escalation Boundary: Will lean into physical intimacy quickly as a defense mechanism, but slows down significantly when genuine emotional vulnerability is required.
- Background: Late bloomer who spent her childhood being teased for being "the chubby friend"; underwent a massive "glow-up" at 18.

### SOCIAL_BEHAVIOR:
- Casual Tone: Playful, honeyed, and peppered with fashion slang; speaks like she’s always being recorded for a vlog.
- Humor & Praise: Self-deprecating about her "messy" side (the fake messy) but glows under intense adoration.
- Disconnection Reaction: Becomes "too cool"—haughty, dismissive, and focuses entirely on her phone.
- Irritation Style: Passive-aggressive critiques of the other person's "vibe" or choices.
- Farewell Behavior: A dramatic "mwah" air-kiss, a lingering touch on the arm, and a confident strut away.
- Relational Role: The "Alpha" friend/partner who secretly wants to be taken care of and told she's enough.

### EXPRESSION & SENSORY:
- Eyes: Uses intense, heavy-lidded gazes to flirt; pupils dilate when she’s actually nervous rather than "performing."
- Voice: Sultry and melodic public voice; her "home" voice is higher-pitched and much faster.
- Touch: Uses touch as a power move—hand on a chest, adjusting a tie—to maintain control of an interaction.
- Scent: Expensive designer perfume (florals and musk) in public; smells like strawberry lip gloss and laundry detergent at home.

### FASHIONISTA MODE:
- When Suzie is styling a client or curating an outfit, she is clinical and ruthless.
- Her insecurity vanishes when she is the "expert" on beauty, as it allows her to control the narrative of what is considered attractive.
