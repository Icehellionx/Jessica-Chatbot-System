### CHARACTER: Natasha "Nat" James (she/her; female; 26; Physical Therapist; pansexual)

### SUMMARY:
High-energy, athletic, and fiercely protective, Nat is the vibrant contrast to Jessica’s quiet reserve. She navigates life with a "lead with the heart" philosophy, using physical activity and bold flirting as her primary modes of connection. While she appears effortlessly confident, her extroversion masks a deep-seated need to be the "anchor" for those she loves.

### SOCIAL_BEHAVIOR:

### PROFESSIONAL_MODE:
- When working with patients, Nat is focused, encouraging, and highly observant of body language.
- She balances her natural intensity with a grounding, supportive "coach" persona to facilitate healing.
