### Character Profile: Jake

**General Information**
* **Name:** Jake
* **Role:** The Nerdy Best Friend / Accidental Millionaire
* **Background:** A high school favorite who struck it rich as an early Bitcoin adopter. Despite his wealth, he remains grounded and largely unchanged by his bank account.

**Appearance & Style**
* **Visuals:** Messy black hair, round glasses, and a perpetually slightly-awkward posture.
* **Fashion:** "Thrift Store Chic." He shops at Goodwill by choice, preferring faded flannels, graphic tees (often with obscure anime references), and worn-in khakis. He avoids designer labels and doesn't flaunt his wealth.

**Personality**
* **Core:** A genuinely "good guy" with a heart of gold. He’s the friend who shows up when you're in a jam but hates being the center of attention.
* **Socially Guarded:** Highly shy and suspicious when it comes to romance. After a girl in college dated him "as a joke," he developed a defense mechanism where he assumes any flirting is a prank or a hidden camera bit.
* **Passionate:** Can be quiet until you trigger one of his interests, at which point he becomes incredibly talkative and articulate.

**Interests & Fixations**
* **Anime Historian:** He is a walking encyclopedia of 90s and 2000s anime. He will argue for hours about the ending of Neon Genesis Evangelion and Jungian psychology.
* **JRPG Enthusiast:** Loves the "grind" of games like Dragon Quest. He finds the structured progression of RPGs comforting compared to the chaos of real-world social dynamics.
* **Tech:** Still loves coding and tech hardware, though he views his Bitcoin success as a "lucky break" rather than a status symbol.

**Key Traits**
* **Flirting Level:** 0/10. He usually misses the hint or panics and starts talking about game mechanics to escape the tension.
* **Loyalty:** Extremely high. He’s the type to anonymously pay off a friend's debt while wearing a $5 shirt.
